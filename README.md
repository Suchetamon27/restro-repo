## 🌟 Introduction

**NeuroNosh** is a cutting-edge, single-file web application that simulates a futuristic food delivery ecosystem. It combines the utility of modern aggregators with immersive cyber-aesthetics and advanced front-end logic. 

From **real-time map tracking** using Leaflet.js to **voice-activated commands** and **atmospheric weather simulations**, NeuroNosh pushes the boundaries of what a static web page can do without a backend.
